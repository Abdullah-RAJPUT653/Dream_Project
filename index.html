    <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
    <HR>
    <P> ABRAJ Collection is a luxury menswear brand. Nowadays, many people lack proper
        fashion sense and often fail to dress well even when they buy expensive clothes. This is concerning because
        people forget how to style luxury wear within a decent budget. I believe there is a solution to this problem.
    </p>

    <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
    <HR>
    <P>My dream project is to establish a premium menswear clothing brand named ABRAJ. This brand will focus on
        delivering high-quality, luxury apparel with a timeless and elegant aesthetic.

        To bring this vision to life, I am seeking an investment of PKR 20 lac. Based on my business model:

        PKR 10 lac will be allocated to product manufacturing, ensuring that each item meets the highest quality
        standards. From the very first day, I want my customers to experience premium fabrics, superior stitching, and
        excellent finishing.

        PKR 10 lac will be used for branding, marketing campaigns, and professional brand shoots to build a strong
        visual identity and online presence.

        Initially, I plan to launch through an online platform, allowing direct-to-consumer sales nationwide. I aim to
        introduce products like Gurkha trousers and old-money aesthetic shirts—a first-of-its-kind offering in
        Pakistan’s menswear industry. My focus is not only on quality but also on creating a lifestyle brand that
        redefines how men dress in a modern yet classic way.</P>

    <h2>BUSINESS MODEL</h2>
    <HR>
    <P>To bring ABRAJ to life, I am seeking an investment of PKR 20 lac. The business model is structured as follows:

        Manufacturing (PKR 10 lac): This will be used to produce high-quality garments using premium fabrics, with
        special attention to craftsmanship, fit, and durability.

        Marketing & Branding (PKR 10 lac): These funds will support brand identity creation, photoshoots, online ads,
        influencer marketing, and content creation for social media platforms.

        ABRAJ will operate as a direct-to-consumer (D2C) brand through an online store, which allows better control over
        branding, customer experience, and margins. Orders will be processed and delivered across Pakistan, and in later
        phases, international expansion will be explored.

    <H2>TARGET AUDIENCE</H2>
    <HR>
    <P>Our primary target audience is men aged 20–40, especially:

        Young professionals and entrepreneurs who seek sophistication in their daily wear.

        Fashion-conscious individuals looking for premium clothing options within Pakistan.

        Customers who appreciate heritage-inspired designs, such as Gurkha trousers and "old money" aesthetic shirts,
        and want to make a bold yet classy statement.

        These men are typically based in urban centers like Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, and are active on social media.
        They are willing to invest in style, comfort, and quality, and are looking for brands that reflect their
        personality and ambition.</P>
